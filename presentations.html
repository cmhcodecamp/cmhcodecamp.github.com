		<h5 class="tight-para">Testing Web Services</h5>
		<p>
This presentation will cover various tools and frameworks for testing Web Services.  We will take SoapUI, JMeter and REST-assured for a spin, and discuss how they may suit for smoke testing, load testing, performance testing, acceptance testing, probing and mocking Web Services. 
Examples will include SOAP and RESTful Web Services using XML and JSON.  Some general tips will be provided on Web Service development.  There will be code examples in Java, but the talk should benefit anyone struggling with Web Service testing.
