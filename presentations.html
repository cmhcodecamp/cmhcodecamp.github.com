		<h5 class="tight-para">Testing Web Services</h5>
		<p>This presentation will cover various tools and frameworks for testing Web Services.  We will take SoapUI, JMeter and REST-assured for a spin, and discuss how they may suit for smoke testing, load testing, performance testing, acceptance testing, probing and mocking Web Services. 
			Examples will include SOAP and RESTful Web Services using XML and JSON.  Some general tips will be provided on Web Service development.  There will be code examples in Java, but the talk should benefit anyone struggling with Web Service testing.

		<h5 class="tight-para">Virtualize your stack with Vagrant and Puppet</h5>
		<p>Want to make it easy to transition your development stack from your laptop to the cloud?  Interested in automating your development environment? We will cover everything you need know, and make sure you hit the ground running. We will walk through configuring a single server in a reliable way, and then scaling that out to your own personal cloud.

		<h5 class="tight-para">How to make your website 3 times faster and ask for a raise</h5>
		<p>Making your website faster doesn’t need months to plan and implement. And you don’t need to go every corner of a website to implement stupid tricks or endless best practices to save a millisecond. Rather you can make it faster in 5 min. Yes, in 5 min. Ohh, you don't have to spend a buck to buy anything.
		Since, 5 minutes won't fill the talk, you will get a happy hour of tips:
		1. How to write JavaScript code that runs faster,
		2. Improve your CSS to make rendering faster,
		3. Optimize images, icons and logos for sites that use tons of images,
		4. Server and network tricks to make page load faster,
		5. Investigate performance and memory leak by using developer tool, page speed, <i>etc.</i>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h5 class="tight-para">High performance Javascript and CSS</h5>
		<p>
		While it’s hard for some to imagine a single website (desktop or mobile) without JavaScript, eternal union isn’t guaranteed.
		Matrimonial harmony is threatened when one of the spouses is caught over-indulging in resources,
		using delicious libraries, chatting up fancy charts/visualization, engaging in two-way binding, engaging with DOM,
		and generally being an insensitive, unresponsive UI. This talk will cover how to save the marriage.
