		<h5 class="tight-para">Testing Web Services</h5>
		<p>This presentation will cover various tools and frameworks for testing Web Services.  We will take SoapUI, JMeter and REST-assured for a spin, and discuss how they may suit for smoke testing, load testing, performance testing, acceptance testing, probing and mocking Web Services. 
			Examples will include SOAP and RESTful Web Services using XML and JSON.  Some general tips will be provided on Web Service development.  There will be code examples in Java, but the talk should benefit anyone struggling with Web Service testing.

		<h5 class="tight-para">Virtualize your stack with Vagrant and Puppet</h5>
		<p>Want to make it easy to transition your development stack from your laptop to the cloud?  Interested in automating your development environment? We will cover everything you need know, and make sure you hit the ground running. We will walk through configuring a single server in a reliable way, and then scaling that out to your own personal cloud.
