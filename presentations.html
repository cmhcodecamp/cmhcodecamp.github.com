		<h5 class="tight-para">Key Note: Those Who Know History are Doomed to Watch Others Repeat It</h5>
		<p>
		Mark Twain said that history doesn't repeat but that it often rhymes.  This is true not only of the history of
		civilization but also of software development.

		The history of computing, like anything, has recurring patterns, cycles, and trends.  Some of them are quite large,
		others are tiny.  Some are significant and others merely amusing.  In this session we will look at some of these from
		the early days of ENIAC all the way to modern mobile phones.
		We will plot them out over the decades, observe their cycles, and come to understand them.  Then, grounded in that history, we will explore some possible outcomes for the
		next few years and wax poetic about what the more distant future might bring.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h5 class="tight-para">Containers are the new virtual</h5>
		<p>
		This talk is an examination of Linux Containers and their use as a lightweight alternative to other virtual implementations such as vmware.
		The talk will focus on Docker.io - an up and coming implementation which is receiving a lot of attention as well as nimblestrat.us a cloud framework which uses Docker.
