		<div class="fancy page-title">The Columbus Code Camp is...</div>
		<p>
		a non-denominational software-development & technology conference in central Ohio.
		The camp includes talks about anything related to software development (for any language, operating system, platform, or work environment). There is always a wide mix of topics and presentation levels (from beginner to professional).
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      The original Code Camp concept was a conglomeration of ideas by many different people across
	      the development community. The idea was simple- provide an off hour forum for the
	      development community to speak and share ideas for them to come and enjoy. The results
	      have been astounding. Code Camps have been held around the world by developers everywhere!</p>

	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      The question is what makes a Code Camp?</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Code Camp name and banner,
	      follow this Manifesto.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      By and For the Developer Community</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      Code Camps are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place
	      for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community
	      interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      Always Free</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      Code Camps are always free for attendees.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      Community-Developed Material</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      The success of the Code Camps is that they are based on community content. All content
	      that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely
	      (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don't want to
	      share or provide to attendees then the Code Camp is not the place for you.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      No Fluff only Code</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      Code Camps are about showing the code. Refer to the previous rule if you have any questions
	      on this.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      Community Ownership</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      The most important element of the Code Camp is always the developer community. All
	      are welcome to attend. Presenters speak without expectation of payment or any
	      other compensation beyond participation in the community.</p> 
	
	    <h5 class="tight-para"> 
	      Never occur during work hours</h5> 
	    <p class="tight-para"> 
	      We need to understand that many times people can't leave work for a day or two to
	      attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Code Camp is that they always
	      occur on weekends.</p>
