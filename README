Columbus Code Camp
Rant Section
	It appears that the original developers were chimpanzees.
	They use some mystery template library but were not interested in
	documenting the name so that future site maintainers could read up
	about it.

	I imagine their thought processes go something like this:
		Hoot Hoot!  I am a monkey!  Hoot Hoot!

Information Section
	This site uses an unknown template library.
	
	The references like this:
		---
		layout: conference
		title: Columbus Code Camp
		---

	at the top of the HTML fragment files (ex. about.html) refer to the conference.html file
	in the _layouts directory and set the "page.title" variable to the value
	"Columbus Code Camp".
