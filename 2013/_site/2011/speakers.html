			<h2 class="fancy">Guy Royse</h2> 
			<p>
				<img src="images/bio/guy.royse.jpg" 
					class="bio-img" alt="Guy Royse" />
					A born and bred Ohio native, Guy has a basic urge to create that has been a burden his entire life. Where others would choose arts and crafts, he has chosen to channel this urge into creating beautiful software.
	        <br/><br/>
	        Guy was introduced to computers before he learned algebra and before Tron. He was immediately and irrevocably sucked into their alluring beauty. In fact, the draw of programming was so strong and one might call his career more of a calling than a choice.
	<br/><br/>
	        He has programmed in several languages over the years -- many of them semi-colon delimited -- including C++, Java, and C#. More recently he has been working with Ruby and JavaScript and believes them to be the future of software development.
	<br/><br/>
	        In his personal life, Guy is a walking geek stereotype interested in role-playing games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky interest in history and linguistics.
	<br/><br/>
	        Guy lives in Westerville, Ohio with his wife, three strapping young lads, and a fat cow-cat named Madeline. In his spare time he volunteers as a Cubmaster for his kids Cubscout Pack.
