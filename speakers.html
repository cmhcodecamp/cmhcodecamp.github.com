				<img src="images/bio/matt.williams.jpeg"
					class="bio-img" alt="Columbus Code Camp"/>
					For as long as I can remember, I've had a desire to be a Renaissance Man. It's a process. Along the way, I've learned that craftsmanship is an essential part of creation, just as creation is a foundation of learning. Learning takes many forms and it's amazing how seemingly unconnected realms relate with each other. Currently my passion lies in the areas of Dev Ops, Cloud Computing, Textiles, and teaching.  In my "free time" I play with my daughter, weave, cook, read books, muck about with computers, and hack Ruby. In previous incarnations, I have been, among other things, a Java instructor for Sun, a Kitchen Bard, and King of the May.
