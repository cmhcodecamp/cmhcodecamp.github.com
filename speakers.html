			<h2 class="fancy">Mark Greenway</h2> 
			<p>
				<img src="http://d2wgfg2ae7ypfb.cloudfront.net/MarkGreenway.jpg" class="bio-img" alt="Mark Greenway"/>

				A web developer since the mid 1990s and a lone dev since the turn of the millenia,
Mark has a unique perspective on the problems of programming. 
From developing "The Daily WTF" style code in his early days, 
to independently synthesizing many common design patterns in his progression in a vacuum. 
Then came a new enlightenment and a realization of the community and its resources. 
This understanding of the pain of doing things the wrong way, leads to a fresh perspective. 
A smart sense of humour and some training from professional speakers make sure that any talk will be both interesting and informative.
