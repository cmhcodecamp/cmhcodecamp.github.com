								  Usability is the single most important tenet that can turn a good app into a great one. Autosaving is a fun aspect of usability that can provide both a better user experience and increased reliability.
	                <br/><br/>
	                Together we will explore how to use Backbone.js and Rails to create autosaving. In the process you'll learn about getting started with Backbone.js and Rails from a pragmatic point-of-view.

								  Tightly coupled applications lead to heartache. They are difficult to manage. They are difficult to maintain. The create applications that are inflexible. They make TDD, or even TAD (Test After Development) all but impossible. It doesn't have to be this way. This session will demonstarte how the concept and practice of Dependency Injection (also known as Inversion of Control) and some easy to use frameworks can help make your application more loosely coupled, more flexible, more maintainable and more testable.

								  Over the decades the ebb and flow of client- vs. server-side architectures has been tossed about on the waves.  Now, the pendulum is swinging toward a client-side approach to application design once again.  But this time the browser is the new operating system and there is no place for server-side content generation -- such as JSPs.  Find out how this impacts the tools we use, the way we build applications, and the implications for the end user.

								  This talk is targeted at intermediate- or higher-level software engineers (no Perl experience required) aka "I program to get work done".  Starting with the one liners to solve common tasks to automation and mechanization we will travel through many different Perl use cases that intersect with our daily home and work lives.

								  Alex would like to introduce you to Concurrency, or the art of making several things happen at once.  This talk will cover a few different strategies and design approaches for coding concurrent systems, including work sharing and asynchronous programming.

	                You can benefit from this talk if you are a beginner to mid-level .Net or Java programmer.  If you already roll 20's with threads, this talk may not be for you, but you are welcome to come and heckle.

	  							Wikipedia says that "Verilog is a hardware-description language used to model electronic systems", but what does that really mean?
	  							<br/><br/>
	                Coming from a C/C++ background, I'll talk about how Verilog is [dis]similar to C/C++. I'll also demonstrate how to write code, including:
	                <ul>
	                <li>basic synthesis</li>
	                <li>basic state machines</li>

								  The Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Python. The goal is to learn the Python language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. It is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in the language.
	                <br/><br/>
	                This session is complementary to the ""Python for Non-Python Programmers"" session. Although the earlier session is not a requirement for attending the Koans session, you might find it to be a useful introduction.

								  Databases generally need reporting tools for their data to be useful.
	                Those tools tend to be difficult to afford and difficult to set up,
	                demanding many hours and highly specialized skills to prepare
	                the tool for business users.

	                HTSQL is a new open-source web gateway for relational databases
	                that can be downloaded, installed, configured, and serving reports
	                all within sixty seconds, beginning from a clean machine.
	                Bring a stopwatch and watch it happen!
	                HTSQL is more than just simple, though.  It introduces a revolutionary
	                language for describing queries that business users can understand, hack, and share.

								  The flexibility and scalability of software often determines its usable life span and the cost of maintenance. The methodology, Qualculus, allows for analysis and design of software which is easier to adapt to future requirements and allows for a more dynamic application. This can reduce development time and a faster turnaround in the software development cycle. This in turn can help reduce cost.
